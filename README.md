## Register a Subdomain

**Currently, we only support GitHub Pages.**

### Set Up Your GitHub Pages Site

First, youâ€™ll need to create your own GitHub Pages site. Use the [official GitHub Pages guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) to do that.

### Add the Domain Config File

1. **Fork this Repository**

   - First, navigate to the repository where you would like to add your subdomain.
   - Click the **Fork** button at the top-right to fork the register repository.

2. **Create the JSON File**

   - In your forked repository, locate the `domains` folder.
   - Click on **Add File** â†’ **Create new file**.
   - Name your file like `<subdomain>.json`. Example: `balls.json`. Before choosing a subdomain, check the existing JSON files in the repo to make sure itâ€™s not already in use.
   - In the file, paste the following:
```json
{
  "owner": {
    "username": "winbo-yml-exe"
  },
  "subdomain": "winbo",
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "winbo-yml-exe.github.io"
  }
}
```
     - Replace `your-subdomain` with your desired subdomain (like `balls` or `rizz`). Before choosing a subdomain, check the existing JSON files in the repo to make sure itâ€™s not already in use.
     - Replace `your-github-website-url` with your actual GitHub Pages Website URL.

3. **Save the File**
   - After entering the information, click **Commit** to save your changes.

### Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Navigate to the **Pull Requests** section of your forked repo.
2. Click on **New Pull Request**.
3. Ensure you are comparing your fork against the original repository (where you want to submit your changes).
4. Title your pull request like `Add <subdomain>.json`
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.

### Wait for Approval

After you submit the pull request, the service maintainers will review it. If everything appears to be in order, they will approve and merge your changes.

### After Your Pull Request Is Merged

Once your pull request is merged, youâ€™ll need to add your subdomain to your GitHub Pages settings.

1. Go to your GitHub Pages repository (the one where your website is hosted).
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
4. In the **Custom domain** field, enter your subdomain in this format: `subdomain.arch-user.name` (Example: `rizz.arch-user.name`).
5. **Do NOT** click the "Enforce HTTPS" option.
6. Save your changes.

### Your subdomain should now be linked to your GitHub Pages site! ðŸŽ‰
